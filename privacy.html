                search
                query to us or contact us for support. We get some of it by recording how you

            <p>
                We also obtain data from third parties. For example, we supplement the data we collect by purchasing
                demographic data from other companies. We also use services from other companies to help us determine a
                location based on your IP address in order to customise certain products to your location.</p>
            <p>
                You have choices about the data we collect. When you are asked to provide personal data, you may
                decline. But if you choose not to provide data that is necessary to provide a product or feature, you
                may not be able to use that product or feature.</p>
            <p>
                The data we collect depends on the products and features you use, and can include the following:</p>

            <p><strong>Name and contact data.</strong> We collect your first and last name, email address, postal
                address, phone number and other similar contact data.</p>
            <p><strong>Credentials.</strong> We collect passwords, password hints and similar security information used
                for authentication and account access to use our PRODUCTS only.</p>

            <p><strong>Demographic data.</strong> We collect data about you such as your age, gender, country and
                preferred language.</p>

            <p><strong>Payment data.</strong> We collect data necessary to process your payment if you make purchases,
                such as your
                payment instrument number (such as a credit card number), and the security code associated with your
                payment instrument.</p>

            <p><strong>Usage data.</strong> We collect data about how you and your device interact with ClayFish and our
                products. For

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Product use data.</strong> We collect data about the features you use, the items you
                    purchase and the web
                    pages you visit. This data includes your voice and text interactions with our products.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Device data.</strong> We collect data about your device and the network you use to connect
                    to our products.
                    It includes data about the operating systems. It also includes IP address, device identifiers (such
                    as the IMEI number for phones),
                    regional and language settings.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Error reports and performance data.</strong> We collect data about the performance of the
                    products and any
                    problems you experience with them. This data helps us to diagnose problems in the products you use,
                    and to improve our products and provide solutions. Depending on your product and settings, error
                    reports can include data such as the type or severity of the problem, details of the software or
                    hardware related to an error, contents of files you were using when an error occurred and data about

                    <strong>Support Data.</strong> When you engage ClayFish for support, we collect data about you and
                    your hardware,
                    software and other details related to the support incident. Such data includes contact or
                    authentication data, the content of your chats and other communications with ClayFish support, data
                    about the condition of the machine and the application when the fault occurred and during
                    diagnostics, and system and registry data about software installations and hardware configurations.
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Interests and favourites.</strong> We collect data about your interests and favourites, such as
                the teams you follow in a sports app, the stocks you track in a finance app or the favourite cities you
                add to a weather app. In addition to those you explicitly provide, your interests and favourites may
                also be inferred or derived from other data we collect.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>
                    Contacts and relationships.</strong> We collect data about your contacts and relationships if you
                use a ClayFish product to manage contacts, or to communicate or interact with other people or

            <p>
                <strong>
                    Location data.</strong> We collect data about your location, which can be either precise or
                imprecise. Precise location data can be Global Position System (GPS) data, as well as data identifying
                nearby cell towers and WiFi hotspots, we collect when you enable location-based products or features.
                Imprecise location data includes, for example, a location derived from your IP address or data that
                indicates where you are located with less precision, such as at a city or postcode level.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    Content.</strong> We collect content of your files and communications when necessary to provide you
                with the products you use.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also collect the content of messages you send to us, such as feedback and product reviews you write,
                or questions and information you provide for customer support. When you contact us, such as for customer
                support, phone conversations or chat sessions with our representatives may be monitored and
                recorded.</p>
