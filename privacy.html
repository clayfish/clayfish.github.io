            <p>
                We also obtain data from third parties. For example, we supplement the data we collect by purchasing
                demographic data from other companies. We also use services from other companies to help us determine a
                location based on your IP address in order to customise certain products to your location.</p>
            <p>
                You have choices about the data we collect. When you are asked to provide personal data, you may
                decline. But if you choose not to provide data that is necessary to provide a product or feature, you
                may not be able to use that product or feature.</p>
            <p>
                The data we collect depends on the products and features you use, and can include the following:</p>

            <p><strong>Name and contact data.</strong> We collect your first and last name, email address, postal
                address, phone number and other similar contact data.</p>

            <p><strong>Credentials.</strong> We collect passwords, password hints and similar security information used
                for authentication and account access to use our PRODUCTS only.</p>

            <p><strong>Demographic data.</strong> We collect data about you such as your age, gender, country and
                preferred language.</p>

            <p><strong>Payment data.</strong> We collect data necessary to process your payment if you make purchases,
                such as your
                payment instrument number (such as a credit card number), and the security code associated with your
                payment instrument.</p>

            <p><strong>Usage data.</strong> We collect data about how you and your device interact with ClayFish and our
                products. For
                example, we collect:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Product use data.</strong> We collect data about the features you use, the items you
                    purchase and the web
                    pages you visit. This data includes your voice and text interactions with our products.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Device data.</strong> We collect data about your device and the network you use to connect
                    to our products.
                    It includes data about the operating systems. It also includes IP address, device identifiers (such
                    as the IMEI number for phones),
                    regional and language settings.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Error reports and performance data.</strong> We collect data about the performance of the
                    products and any
                    problems you experience with them. This data helps us to diagnose problems in the products you use,
                    and to improve our products and provide solutions. Depending on your product and settings, error
                    reports can include data such as the type or severity of the problem, details of the software or
                    hardware related to an error, contents of files you were using when an error occurred and data about

                    <strong>Support Data.</strong> When you engage ClayFish for support, we collect data about you and
                    your hardware,
                    software and other details related to the support incident. Such data includes contact or
                    authentication data, the content of your chats and other communications with ClayFish support, data
                    about the condition of the machine and the application when the fault occurred and during
                    diagnostics, and system and registry data about software installations and hardware configurations.
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Interests and favourites.</strong> We collect data about your interests and favourites, such as
                the teams you follow in a sports app, the stocks you track in a finance app or the favourite cities you
                add to a weather app. In addition to those you explicitly provide, your interests and favourites may
                also be inferred or derived from other data we collect.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>
                    Contacts and relationships.</strong> We collect data about your contacts and relationships if you
                use a ClayFish product to manage contacts, or to communicate or interact with other people or
                organisations.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    Location data.</strong> We collect data about your location, which can be either precise or
                imprecise. Precise location data can be Global Position System (GPS) data, as well as data identifying
                nearby cell towers and WiFi hotspots, we collect when you enable location-based products or features.
                Imprecise location data includes, for example, a location derived from your IP address or data that
                indicates where you are located with less precision, such as at a city or postcode level.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    Content.</strong> We collect content of your files and communications when necessary to provide you
                with the products you use.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also collect the content of messages you send to us, such as feedback and product reviews you write,
                or questions and information you provide for customer support. When you contact us, such as for customer
                support, phone conversations or chat sessions with our representatives may be monitored and
                recorded.</p>

        <p class="summary-personal-data-usage">ClayFish uses the data we collect to provide you the products we offer,
            which includes using data to improve
            and personalise your experiences. We also may use the data to communicate with you, for example, informing
            you about your account, security updates and product information. And we use data to help show more relevant
            ads, whether in our own products, or in products offered by third parties. However, we do
            not use what you say in email, chat, video calls or voice mail, or your documents, photos or other personal

                ClayFish uses the data we collect for three basic purposes, described in more detail below: (1) to
                operate our business and provide (including improving and personalising) the products we offer, (2) to
                send communications, including promotional communications and (3) for some products, to show
                advertising.
            </p>

            <p>
                In carrying out these purposes, we combine data we collect to give you a more seamless, consistent and
                personalised experience. However, to enhance privacy, we have built in technological and procedural
                safeguards designed to prevent certain data combinations. For example, we store data we collect from you
                when you are unauthenticated (not signed in) separately from any account information that directly
                identifies you, such as your name, email address or phone number.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Providing and improving our products.</strong> We use data to provide and improve the products
                we offer and perform essential business operations. This includes operating the products, maintaining
                and improving the performance of the products, including developing new features, research and providing
                customer support. Examples of such uses include the following.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Providing the Products.</strong> We use data to carry out your transactions with us and to
                    provide our products to you. Often, those products include personalised features and recommendations
                    that enhance your productivity and enjoyment, and tailor your product experiences based on your
                    activities, interests and location.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Customer support.</strong> We use data to diagnose product problems and provide other
                    customer care and support services.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Product Improvement.</strong> We use data to continually improve our products, including
                    adding new features or capabilities, such as using error reports to improve security features, using
                    search queries to improve the relevancy of the search results, using usage data
                    to determine what new features to prioritise.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Security, Safety and Dispute Resolution.</strong> We use data to protect the security and
                    safety of our products and our customers, to detect and prevent fraud, to confirm the validity of
                    software licences, to resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Business Operations.</strong> We use data to develop aggregate analysis and business
                    intelligence that enable us to operate, protect, make informed decisions and report on the
                    performance of our business.

                <strong>Communications.</strong> We use data we collect to deliver and personalise our communications
                with you. For example, we may contact you by email or other means to inform you when a subscription is
                ending, let you know when security updates are available, remind you about items left in your online
                shopping cart, update you or inquire about a service or repair request, invite you to participate in a
                survey or tell you that you need to take action to keep your account active. Additionally, you can sign
                up for email subscriptions and choose whether you wish to receive promotional communications from
                us by email, SMS, post and telephone. For information about managing email subscriptions and

            <p><strong>Advertising.</strong> Many of our products are supported by advertising. We use the data we
                collect to help select some of the ads you see in our products. We partner with third parties such as
                Google, Microsoft and other advertising companies to select and deliver display ads to our sites and
                apps, as well as other sites and apps serviced by these partners. The ads we select may be based on your
                current location, search query or the content you are viewing. Other ads are targeted based on your
                likely interests or other information that we learn about you over time using demographic data, search
                queries, interests and favourites, usage data from our own sites and apps and the sites and apps of our
                advertisers and partners and location data - which we refer to as "interest-based advertising" in this
                statement. ClayFish does not use what you say in email, chat, video calls or voice mail, or your
                documents, photos or other personal files to target ads to you. More information about advertising
                controls is available in the <a

                    display, enabling them to set and read their own cookie. Additionally, ClayFish partners with
                    third-party ad companies to help provide some of our advertising services, and we also allow other
                    third-party ad companies to display advertisements on our sites. These third parties may place
                    cookies on your computer and collect data about your online activities across websites or online
                    services.

        <p class="summary-access-control-data">
            You can view or edit your personal data in the app you are using. You can also make choices about our
            collection and use of your data. How you can access or control your personal data will depend on which
            products you use.</p>
        <p class="summary-access-control-data">
            You can always choose whether you wish to receive promotional emails, SMS messages, telephone calls and
            postal mail from us. You can also opt out from receiving interest-based advertising from our advertising
            partners by visiting opt-out page of Google for our Android apps.
        </p>

        <span class="btn btn-link learn-more" data-target="access-control-data">Learn More</span>

        <div class="more more-access-control-data hide">
            <p>You can view or edit your personal data in the app for many of our apps. You can also make choices
                about our collection and use of your data. How you can access or control your personal data will
                depend on which products you use.</p>

            <p>If you cannot access certain personal data collected by ClayFish directly through
                the ClayFish products you use, you can always contact <a href="app-support.html">ClayFish Support</a>.
                We will respond to requests to access or delete your personal data within 30 days.</p>

            <h4>Your communication preferences</h4>
            <p>You can choose whether you wish to receive promotional communications from ClayFish by email, SMS,
                postal mail and telephone. If you receive promotional emails or SMS messages from us and would like to
                opt out, you can do so by following the directions in those messages. You can also make choices about
                the receipt of promotional email, telephone calls, and postal mail by the our app you are using which
                allows you to update contact information, manage contact preferences, opt out of email
                subscriptions and choose whether to share your contact information with our partners. These choices do
                not apply to mandatory service communications that are part of certain ClayFish services, or to surveys
                or other informational communications that have their own unsubscribe method.</p>

            <h4>Your advertising choices</h4>
            <p>You may opt out of receiving interest-based advertising from within our apps and from Google ad-services.
                Because the data used for interest-based advertising is also used for other necessary purposes
                (including providing our products, analytics and fraud detection), opting out of interest-based
                advertising does not stop that data from being collected. Nor does it mean you will stop getting ads or
                see fewer ads. However, if you do opt out, the ads you receive will no longer be interest-based and may
                be less relevant to your interests.</p>
